# challenge_amadeus
Amadeus challenge in order to join their teams.


First Exercise :
  - Lack of computing capacity
  - Just need the number of rows, one column is enough


Second exercise :
  Issues and results :
    - Cannot install properly Geobases or Neobase
    - We can get airport name by using http://fr.whattheflight.com/aeroports/codes-iata-oaci/ (not programtically)
    - After viewing Geobase structure and methods, the code to find city name or airport is at the end of the file.

IMPORTANT : I finally put my results and observation directly in the ipynb files, or into the mail.
